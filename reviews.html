            <h2>Martha Monk, Sri Lankan Feast</h2>
            <p>"So, I had the most incredible experience last weekend, and I cannot help but share it with you all. I've been vegan for 10 yrs and my journey has been an experiment of sorts, navigating through ingredients and recipes. I will admit; there have been a few kitchen mishaps and "interesting" creations along the way. üòÖ
                Based on a previous community post, I invited Teresa Stone, a well-versed vegan chef, to guide me through preparing an authentic Sri Lankan meal. She isn't just a chef; she's a master at her craft!
                Our time in the kitchen was nothing short of magical. Teresa made the whole cooking process look so simple and approachable. We dived into an ocean of explosive Sri Lankan spices, flavors, and colors. The menu and recipes she developed was magnificent! Based on my preferences she revolutionized and created a recipe just for us!
                Every dish was a masterpiece, perfectly balanced with spices and truly exuding the essence of Sri Lankan cuisine...every dish was a star.
                But the best part of the experience was learning from Teresa. She was patient, knowledgeable, and most importantly, passionate about vegan cuisine. Her enthusiasm was infectious, her tips invaluable, and the techniques she taught me were easy to follow.
                This truly was an inspiring experience, one that improved not only my cooking skills but also my understanding of how delightful and diverse vegan cuisine can be.
                To all our friends looking to explore the vegan lifestyle or simply enjoy delicious food, Teresa is your go-to guide. Trust me; it's an amazing experience that you won't want to miss!"

            "I was the main recipient of the cooking class. It was a birthday gift from my sons and daughter-in-laws. It was an excellent experience and I highly recommend Teresa Stone and this type of gift for anyone looking for that ‚Äúspecial‚Äù gift.
            Teresa was so professional yet very friendly and engaging. She brought everything to my house! Food, spices, pots, pans, food processors, blenders, utensils and everything was planned out ahead of time. We could do as much or as little as we wanted in the preparation of the food. We decided to be very hands on. She even brought extra containers to take home the dirty items as she didn‚Äôt want me to have to clean up anything!
            And, most importantly, the food was so delicious and I learned so much. I‚Äôve been a vegan for 20 years but have never used spices and nuts the way Teresa helped us to prepare. It was so much fun!
            Yes, thank you Teresa! Whether you have just started your vegan journey or have been vegan for a while, I highly recommend enjoying a cooking class with Teresa!"

            "Hello all, I wanted to share the experience our family had with Teresa Stone yesterday evening. Teresa joined us in my parents home to lead us through a vegan cooking class. We did a full three course meal including a bruschetta with cashew ricotta and freshly made pesto topped with roasted cherry tomatoes, vegan fettuccine alfredo and a spicy chocolate shortbread with raspberry sauce.
            It was obvious that Teresa has put a lot of time, thought and effort into her recipes which I‚Äôm sure have taken her years to develop. We should have taken some pictures but ate up everything before thinking about it! You can see some of Teresa‚Äôs work on the YouTube channel Top Vegan.
            Thank you again Teresa! Anyone who thinks they would benefit from taking a vegan cooking class Teresa comes very highly recommended."

            "If you're looking for a fun date night or to learn something new, I highly recommend taking an online private cooking class with @veganfooding.and.shooting! We saw her on @topvegantv, decided to reach out to try her delicious food and she made up an online version of her cooking class just for us! It was an amazing evening and the food was to die for ü§§"
